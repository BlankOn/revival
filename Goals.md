# Goals

The BlankOn Linux project has two EQUALLY important goals:

## 1. Building People

To provide an environment that empowers individuals to develop their capabilities. Anyone can learn various aspects of building open-source products and understand how to contribute effectively to open-source projects.

BlankOn Linux is a "factory for exceptional people", a place where contributors grow, gain real experience, and sharpen their skills through meaningful collaboration.

## 2. Building a Sustainable Product

To deliver a high-quality and sustainable product for users: a Linux distribution designed to meet the general-purpose needs of the Indonesian community.

The project is committed not only to technical excellence, but also to long-term sustainability and relevance for its users.
