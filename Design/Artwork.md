# Artwork

## Guidelines

### 1. Cultural Identity

If possible, the visual identity should reflect Indonesia's cultural roots and values. Incorporate local elements thoughtfully and respectfully, without being overly literal or decorative. The goal is to express identity in a modern, relevant, and globally understandable way.

### 2. Reasonable Color Palette

Use a balanced and intentional color palette. Avoid excessive saturation or too many competing colors. Ensure harmony between primary and secondary colors, and maintain sufficient contrast for accessibility in both light and dark modes.

### 3. Consistency

Maintain visual consistency across all components: icons, themes, wallpapers, boot screens, and promotional materials. Spacing, typography, corner radius, shadow depth, and color usage should follow a unified design system for each release.

### 4. Open Format

All artwork must use open and editable formats whenever possible (e.g., SVG instead of proprietary formats). This ensures transparency, easier collaboration, long-term maintainability, and alignment with open-source principles. The use of closed-source design tools is allowed. However, all final and source assets must be stored and shared in open, editable formats (such as SVG) to ensure transparency, long-term maintainability, and alignment with open-source values.

### 5. No Generative AI

The use of generative AI for creating artwork is not permitted at this time. This policy may be reviewed and re-evaluated periodically as technology, legal considerations, and community perspectives evolve.
