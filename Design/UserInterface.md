# User Interface Guidelines

## Design Principles

### 1. Keep It Simple

Prioritize clarity and ease of use. Avoid unnecessary complexity in both functionality and interface design.

### 2. Provide Flexibility Through Choice

Offer users meaningful options to customize their experience, ensuring flexibility without overwhelming them.

### 3. Bridge Conventional and Modern UI Paradigms

Strive to find a balance between the traditional desktop metaphor and modern UI/UX approaches, combining familiarity with contemporary design practices.

### 4. Listen to Users

Actively gather feedback and continuously improve the product based on real user needs and experiences. Design decisions should be informed by user voices, not assumptions.
