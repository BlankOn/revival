# How to Contribute

## Getting Started

The quickest way to start contributing is by joining our Telegram group (https://t.me/BlankOnLinux/51909). Follow the ongoing discussions, understand the current priorities, and take action to help the team as a Freelance Contributor.

If you believe you can commit to the project as a serious long-term side endeavor, either as a Core Contributor or a Mentee. please send an email to blankon-dev@googlegroups.com.

We will arrange a meeting to exchange expectations, discuss responsibilities, and ensure mutual [understanding about the project's direction](https://github.com/BlankOn/revival/blob/main/Goals.md) and your potential role within it.
