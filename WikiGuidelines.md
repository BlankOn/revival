# Wiki Guidelines

## Wiki Structure

Document placement must follow the existing structure and conventions. If you are unsure where a document should be placed, please consult with other developers before proceeding.

Directory and file names must use PascalCase (first letter capitalized, no spaces).

## Language

English is preferred for all documentation.

If you are not confident writing in English, you may draft it in Bahasa Indonesia first. However, directory and file names must always be written in English.
